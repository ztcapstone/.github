\section*{Article I --- Definitions and Ratings}

    \subsection*{Section A. Fleets and Classes of Boats}
    
    In the context of Club Policies, the term \textbf{Dinghy} is understood to include the Bravo, Single-Handed, Double-Handed, Performance, Sailboard, and Catamaran Fleets, unless otherwise specified.
    
    \begin{enumerate}
    
        \item \textbf{Bravo Fleet} \\
        12 foot long cat-rigged (having a single sail) catamarans. These are the Club's most beginner-friendly boats. They can be sailed by one person, but have room for additional crew as well.
    
        \item \textbf{Single-Handed Fleet} \\
        14 foot long cat-rigged, daggerboard (removable centerboard) dinghies that are sailed by one person. They may be rigged as a Laser Radial using a shorter Radial mast and smaller Radial sail.
    
        \item \textbf{Double-Handed Fleet} \\
        Beginner-friendly sloop-rigged (having two basic sails) dinghies designed to be sailed by two people (one skipper and one crew).  
        The primary Double-Handed boats are the Flying Juniors (FJ), which are 13 feet long with a centerboard. The Fleet also includes the Laser 2 (14.5 feet with a daggerboard), RS Vision (15 feet with a centerboard), and an International 470 (I-470) (15.5 feet with a centerboard).\\\\The FJs, Laser 2, and RS Vision may be used for beginner instruction and Novice Ratings Tests, while the 470 may also be used for Intermediate and Skipper Ratings Tests.
    
        \item \textbf{Performance Fleet} \\
        High-performance sloop-rigged, centerboard dinghies. These boats require a Specialty Rating to sail and include the International 505 and the International 14 (I-14).
    
        \item \textbf{Sailboard Fleet} \\
        The Sailboard Fleet consists of many combinations of boards, booms, masts, mast extenders, sails, and universal joints that may be rigged together and sailed by one person.
    
        \item \textbf{Catamaran Fleet} \\
        Sloop-rigged sailboats with multiple hulls.
    
        \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
    
            \item \textbf{Novice Catamarans} \\
            16 to 17 foot long catamarans suitable for beginner instruction and Novice Ratings Tests. These are represented by Hobie 16s and a Dart.
    
            \item \textbf{Big Cats} \\
            Catamarans longer than 17 feet, intended for more experienced catamaran sailors. They require a Specialty Rig Rating to sail.
    
        \end{enumerate}
    
        \item \textbf{Daysailer Fleet} \\
        Sloop-rigged sailboats from 19 to 22 feet in length that may comfortably hold four or more crew.  
        The Flying Scot has a centerboard and can be sailed by a Double-Handed Novice.  
        The other Daysailers have a fixed keel and require a Double-Handed Intermediate Rating to sail.
    
        \item \textbf{Keelboat Fleet}
    
        \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
    
            \item \textbf{Outboard Keelboats} \\
            Keelboats between 24 and 27 feet in length with outboard engines. These may be sailed with a Keelboat Novice Rating.
    
            \item \textbf{Inboard Keelboats} \\
            Keelboats greater than 27 feet in length with engines installed inside them. These require a Keelboat Skipper Rating and separate Rig Ratings to sail. They may not participate in Duck Dodge.
    
            \item \textbf{Ithaka} \\
            \emph{Ithaka} is a 44 foot Swan 441 keelboat—the largest sailboat owned by the Club. Its usage is governed by the Ithaka Policy Document.
    
        \end{enumerate}
    
        \item \textbf{Whaler Fleet} \\
        Rescue powerboats maintained for the purpose of rescue and instruction.
