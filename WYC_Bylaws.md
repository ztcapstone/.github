## Article VI - Chiefs 
### Section A. Chiefs 
1. Purpose 
The primary purpose of maintaining an active set of Chiefs of the Club is to identify and recognize Members who show good judgment in matters of safety and a willingness to continue to contribute their advice and efforts to supporting the Members and the activities of the Club. Their substantial knowledge, abilities, and experience with the Club benefits the continued success of the Club as a whole. 
2. Requirements and Appointment Process 
To become a Chief, a Member must have a Whaler Rating and one or more Skipper Ratings They must be nominated at a General Meeting or an Executive Council Meeting and then be approved by a majority vote. During the nomination process, the Fleets for which the Chief will hold Designated Chief status will be decided on. If approved, there will be a probationary period of six months, during which the Chief designation may be revoked by a majority vote of the Executive Council or the General Membership.

A windsurf chief must hold at least a windsurf skipper rating and be familiar with:
* Undertaking a risk assessment of environment and provide a safety-related chalk talk before supervising windsurfers on the water.
* Club supervision/teaching boundaries and rescue policies.
* Having different methods for preventing windsurfers from entering dangerous situations.
* Explaining and demonstrating members windsurfing out of dangerous situations.
* Rescuing windsurfers from dangerous situations.
* Using a stand-up paddleboard.
* Calling emergency services or for outside help.
A windsurf chief does not need a whaler rating.


4. Duties 
The duties and the responsibilities of a Chief, to be exercised with discretion and courtesy, are outlined below: 

a. Oversee Club Member Safety 

Chiefs are expected to use their good judgment and their understanding of sailing, weather, and safe rescue Whaler operation to oversee the safety of club members out on the water. However, a Chief is not authorized to criticize Members when they are engaged in recreational sailing except in the case of danger to life, limb, or equipment. 

b. Removal of Club Members from Unsafe Situations 

If the safety of Club Members is believed to be in danger due to poor conditions, poor sailing ability, or poor judgment on behalf of Club Member(s), the Chief should put their best effort into ensuring the safe return to land of the Club Member(s) and seek outside assistance if deemed necessary. If warranted, the Chief may remove the sailing permissions of the Member(s) for a period of two days, and the Chief should inform the Officers and/or Executive Council about the event at their earliest convenience, such that any appropriate repercussions for the incident may be determined. 

c. Enforcement of Club Rules 

Chiefs may reprimand Club Members if they are found to be in violation of the Club’s By-Laws or Policies. Chiefs may remove the privileges of club members, such as access to indoor facilities and Club vessels, if warranted, for a period of two days. Following such an incident, the Chief should inform the Officers and/or Executive Council about the event at their earliest convenience, such that the appropriate repercussions for the incident may be determined. 

d. Administer Ratings and Written Tests 

When possible, Chiefs should administer Ratings Tests and Written Tests and assist with the training of Members if their qualifications and knowledge allow them to do so.

e. Executive Council 

Chiefs are encouraged to attend Executive Council Meetings and provide their input about current Club matters. Chiefs who are also Regular Members are part of the Executive Council and may vote at Executive Council Meetings. 

4. Special Provision for Officers
   
The Officers shall automatically become Chiefs upon their election if they possess the necessary Ratings to be eligible. They shall be expected to fulfill this Ratings requirement as soon as possible if they are able, but they will not become a Chief until they do so.

### Section B. Designated Chief 
1. Definitions
   
Designated Chiefs for a specific fleet of vessels may give Skipper Ratings for that fleet of vessels. For example, a Designated Catamaran Chief may give Catamaran Skipper Ratings, but they may give no other Skipper Ratings if they do not hold a Designation for those other fleets. A Designated Whaler Chief may give one type of Whaler Rating; separate Whaler Novice and Whaler Skipper ratings do not exist. The individual types of Designated Chiefs make up the entire set of Chiefs of the Club. 

For simplicity, the word “Designated” does not have to be stated in order to understand that a Chief is a Designated Chief for the specific fleet of vessels indicated. For example, a “Catamaran Chief” may be understood to be a Chief who holds a Catamaran Designation and they do not explicitly have to be referred to as a Designated Catamaran Chief. 

2. Designated Chief Types

Designated Chiefs exist for six fleets of club vessels: Single-Handed, Double-Handed, Windsurf Skipper Examiner, Windsurf Captain, Catamaran, Keelboat, and Whaler. 

3. Requirements and Appointment Process
   
To become a Designated Chief for a fleet of vessels, one must be a Chief, have a Skipper Rating for that fleet (or a general Whaler Rating to be considered for a Whaler Designation). If possible, for the Single-Handed, Double-Handed, Sailboard, and Catamaran fleets, an existing Designated Chief for the fleet in question should give their approval for the Member to proceed with being considered for appointment. However, to be considered specifically for a Whaler Designation or Keelboat Designation, one or more existing Whaler Chiefs or Keelboat Chiefs, respectively, must support the Member being considered for this appointment.

A Windsurf Skipper Examiner Designated Chief can give Skipper ratings, while a Windsurf Captain Examiner Designated Chief can give Captains ratings. A Windsurf Skipper Examiner Designated Chief, who then receives their windsurf captain rating does not automatically become a Windsurf Captain Examiner. To receive the Windsurf Captain Examiner, the sailor must have a Captain rating, be given approval for appointment by one or more existing Windsurf Captain Examiner Chiefs, and be considered for appointment by the executive council.

A Windsurf Skipper and Windsurf Captains Examiner Designated Chief must hold a Windsurf Badge - Level 1, the Captains Examiner must also hold a Gorge Windsurf Badge and Power Gybe Badge.


4. Exception for Granting of Keelboat Novice Ratings
   
Any Chief who is a Keelboat Skipper may give a Keelboat Novice Rating, but the Club is encouraged to continue to evaluate whether that Keelboat Skipper should be considered for appointment as a Designated Keelboat Chief as they continue to gain experience and show continued good judgment.
