            Ratings Examiners may check out Members for vessels in which the Members are not rated and supervise their safe sailing of those vessels.

        \subsubsection*{4. Dues Exemption}
        
            Ratings Examiners are dues exempt for any quarters in which they commit to providing 10 or more hours of service to the Club’s instructional programs. These may be paid hours if applicable. 
        
        \subsubsection*{5. Wages}
        
            Ratings Examiners who are not Officers may ask to be paid for their hours of service to the Club’s programs, pending approval by a majority vote of the General Membership or Executive Council. Their desired work hours will be coordinated with the Vice Commodore. During work hours, the Ratings Examiner will be on duty in service of the club. The Ratings Examiner’s primary job is to administer Practical Tests and Written Exams, and to supervise sailing activity. When not performing those duties, the Ratings Examiner will provide other services to the Club such as boat maintenance, facilities maintenance, or other tasks that the Club requires. 
        
        \subsubsection*{6. Assistant Ratings Examiners}

                \item At least one Instructor for each class must hold a Whaler Rating. If a Member wishes to become an Instructor, the Club will prioritize the training of potential Instructors in safe Whaler usage (provided that they hold a Boater Education Card).
        
                \item To become an Instructor, one should have a Skipper Rating for the class that they wish to teach. Alternatively, to teach a Dinghy Class (Single-Handed, Double-Handed, Sailboard, or Catamaran), they may have an Intermediate Rating for the class that they wish to teach and at least one other Dinghy Skipper rating, and be approved by the Vice Commodore. 
        
                \item If approved by the Vice Commodore, Members with only Intermediate Ratings but with prior experience serving as a Co Instructor may serve as an Instructor for Novice Dinghy classes for the Fleet in which they hold the Intermediate Rating
        
                \item Instructors should have already passed the Dinghy Novice Written Test, and they should attempt to pass the Dinghy Skipper Written Test before teaching their next class. 
        
        \end{enumerate}

        \subsubsection*{3. Duties and Privileges}
        \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
                \item Instructors may check out Members for vessels in which the Members are not rated within the defined scope of the class that is being taught. 
        
                \item Instructors may only give Ratings Tests to students in their own classes. After a class has concluded, with the approval of the Vice Commodore, Instructors may continue to supervise the sailing of their former students for the remainder of the quarter, with the goal of allowing the student to earn the Rating designated by the class that they took.  
        
                \item During classes, Instructors should supervise the performance of instructional duties by Assistant Instructors, and they may allow the Assistant Instructor to practice driving a rescue Whaler on which they are aboard when this can be done safely (provided that the Member holds a Boater Education Card). 
        \end{enumerate}

        \subsubsection*{4. Dues Exemption}
            Instructors are dues exempt for any quarters in which they commit to teaching one or more classes.

        \subsubsection*{5. Assistant Instructors}
        
        \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
                \item To become an Assistant Instructor, one must have at least an Intermediate Rating corresponding to the class in which they wish to assist. 
        
                \item They will be under the supervision of an Instructor who is responsible for training of the Assistant Instructor. Assistant Instructors assist an Instructor in all duties related to the teaching of their class. However, they may not perform any of these duties unless the supervising Instructor is present.  
        
                \item Separately, Club Members with Dinghy certifications for similar vessels from formal sailing certification bodies or other significant demonstrated experience (e.g., competitive sailing experience) may serve as Assistant Instructors if they pass the Novice Dinghy Written Test, but they should try to test for our Club Ratings as soon as reasonable. 
        
                \item Assistant Instructors are encouraged to obtain a Boater Education Card prior to teaching so that they have the opportunity to practice operating the Whalers during their classes. 
                
        \end{enumerate}

        \subsubsection*{6. Co-Instructors}
        Two Members who meet the requirements for being Assistant Instructors may teach a class in pairs, at the discretion of the Vice Commodore. 

\section*{Article VI --- Chiefs}

    \subsection*{Section A. Chiefs}

        \subsubsection*{1. Purpose}
            The primary purpose of maintaining an active set of Chiefs of the Club is to identify and recognize Members who show good judgment in matters of safety and demonstrate a willingness to contribute their advice and efforts to support Club Members and Club activities. Their substantial knowledge, abilities, and experience benefit the continued success of the Club as a whole.
        
        \subsubsection*{2. Requirements and Appointment Process}
            To become a Chief, a Member must have a Whaler Rating and at least one Skipper Rating.  
            They must be nominated at a General Meeting or an Executive Council Meeting and then approved by a majority vote. During the nomination process, the specific fleets for which the Chief will hold Designated Chief status will be decided.  
            If approved, the Member enters a six-month probationary period during which the Chief designation may be revoked by a majority vote of the Executive Council or the General Membership.

        \subsubsection*{3. Duties}
        The duties and responsibilities of a Chief—exercised with discretion and courtesy—are as follows:
        
        \begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{\alph*.}]
                \item \textbf{Oversee Club Member Safety}
        
                Chiefs are expected to use sound judgment and their understanding of sailing, weather, and safe Whaler operation to oversee the safety of Club Members on the water.A Chief may not criticize Members engaged in recreational sailing except in cases of danger to life, limb, or equipment.
        
                \item \textbf{Removal of Club Members from Unsafe Situations}
        
                If Club Members are believed to be in danger due to poor conditions, poor sailing ability, or poor judgment, a Chief should make their best effort to ensure the Members return safely to land and may seek outside assistance if necessary.
        
                \item \textbf{Enforcement of Club Rules}
        
                Chiefs may reprimand Members in violation of the Club’s By-Laws or Policies.They may remove Member privileges—including access to indoor facilities and Club vessels—for up to two days when warranted. After doing so, the Chief must inform the Officers and/or Executive Council at their earliest convenience.
        
                \item \textbf{Administer Ratings and Written Tests}
        
                Chiefs should administer Ratings Tests and Written Tests when possible and assist with Member training whenever qualified to do so.
        
                \item \textbf{Executive Council}
        
                Chiefs are encouraged to attend Executive Council Meetings and contribute their perspective on Club matters.Chiefs who are also Regular Members are Voting Members of the Executive Council.
        
        
        \end{enumerate}




        \subsubsection*{4. Special Provision for Officers}
            Officers automatically become Chiefs upon their election if they already meet the ratings requirements.  
            If they do not, they are expected to complete the requirements as soon as possible; they do not become Chiefs until the requirements are met.


    \subsection*{Section B. Designated Chief}

        \subsubsection*{1. Definitions}
        Designated Chiefs for a specific fleet are authorized to give Skipper Ratings for that fleet. For example, a Catamaran Chief may give Catamaran Skipper Ratings, and a Whaler Chief may give Whaler Ratings. Separate Whaler Novice and Whaler Skipper ratings do not exist. The set of all Designated Chiefs constitutes the full set of Chiefs of the Club.\\\\For simplicity, the word “Designated” may be omitted in casual reference.  
        For example, “Catamaran Chief” is understood to mean a Chief designated for the Catamaran fleet.
        
        \subsubsection*{2. Designated Chief Types}
        Designated Chiefs exist for the following six fleets: Single-Handed, Double-Handed, Sailboard, Catamaran, Keelboat, Whaler.
        
        
        \subsubsection*{3. Requirements and Appointment Process}
        To become a Designated Chief for a fleet, a Member must already be a Chief, and hold the Skipper Rating for that fleet (or hold a Whaler Rating for consideration as a Whaler Chief). If possible, for the Single-Handed, Double-Handed, Sailboard, and Catamaran fleets, an existing Designated Chief of that fleet should endorse the appointment. For Whaler or Keelboat Designations, endorsement from one or more existing Whaler or Keelboat Chiefs, respectively, is required.
        
        \subsubsection*{4. Exception for Granting of Keelboat Novice Ratings}
        Any Chief who is a Keelboat Skipper may give a Keelboat Novice Rating. The Club is encouraged to assess whether such a Chief should be considered for appointment as a Designated Keelboat Chief as they gain experience and demonstrate continued good judgment.
